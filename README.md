## üöÄ Deployment

This website is automatically deployed using a CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions:

1.  **Trigger:** Pushes to the `main` branch initiate the deployment workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
2.  **Build/Sync:** The workflow checks out the repository code.
3.  **AWS Sync:** It uses `aws s3 sync` to upload the website files (excluding `.git/` and `.github/` directories) to an AWS S3 bucket configured for static website hosting. The `--delete` flag ensures the bucket mirrors the repository content.
4.  **Serving:** [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) sits in front of the S3 bucket, providing:
    * DNS resolution for `aidancorcoran.dev`.
    * CDN caching for improved performance.
    * Free SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS).
